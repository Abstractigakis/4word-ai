    "The purpose of this repo is to generate puzzles for the 4 word game.  The challenge is estimating how a difficult a puzzle is given that we lack real user data.  When we dont have data, machine learning cant work, so we have to rely on math to generate smart heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use the minimum possible solve path as the main metric for the difficulty. This almost does well enough on its own, accept for 2 caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This apporach does not account for the number of paths from a to b assume a puzzle is solved in only a few steps, but it there is only one way to do it.  If the player does not know this word, they will be forced to guess, or be stuck\n",
    "2. We dont account for word frequency.  i.e. say a game is solvable in a short amount of steps, but it requires the user to know a very obscure word.  In this case the puzzle should be more difficult"
